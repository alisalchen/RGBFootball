 Project for Rice Games!

.exe and .app are both located inside the Builds folder!

Warning: game is... pretty hard LOL.

This was made for a coding project in my application for Rice Games. A very simple project, there was a lot that I could have improved on. 
This was also my first time really having to use JSON in a Unity project, so this was a great learning experience for me! Definitely underestimated the time it would take for me to fully understand how it works :P
I know using external tools Json.NET would have benefitted, but I wanted to familiarize myself with Unity's built in basic json utility. 

Trying to parse the color as an array of 4 float to be stored in a Vector4 struct didn't go so smoothly, so I ended up using strings to set the colors of the materials. This is definitely something I want to reiterate upon and try to implement (as well as making the game overall look way nicer lol).

Hopefully I can keep updating this project and make some 3D models for it + actually find a nice font to go with the UI. :)
